# COVID19-Vaccine-Effectiveness

The state-flipped csv files are for the LSTM Neural Network and the normal csv files are for the Autoregressive Model.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the most devastating events in recent history, resulting in
millions of deaths and destruction on the global economy. While vaccines have been developed to slow the
spread of the virus and achieve global herd immunity, millions of US citizens refuse to take them due to
speculation regarding their safety and effectiveness. Our project goal is to reassure people that COVID vaccines
are effective at controlling the spread of the virus and reducing the number of people infected. To demonstrate
this, we use an autoregressive (AR) model and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to represent the spread
of COVID over time. Using data from various US states, we display COVID trends over the last year and make
predictions on how the disease will spread in the future (beyond the scope of our data set) with and without
vaccines. In the end, our predictions show that vaccines are effective at reducing cases and slowing the spread
of the disease. By comparing results from both models for each state, we were able to choose the more accurate
model and use it for our graphs and predictions. After comparing sources of error in our models (root mean
square error and coefficient of determination), our results indicated that the LSTM neural network was much
more accurate than the autoregressive model.
